# reCycl3R

A Flutter project for Accenture.

Proposal submitted that made us one of the finalists of Accenture's Program the Future 2021:

A 2019 research article states that the country produces an average of 41000 tons of garbage daily, contributing to over one-third of the world's ocean plastic waste. This indicates the countryâ€™s waste management crisis. We shall utilize Flutter and Firebase in creating a simple simulation game that will help in developing awareness for waste reduction and pollution. A virtual robot on an adventurous mission needs to identify whether the items found in different game locations should be reduced, re-used, or recycled. Choosing the wrong option would display the right method for waste management.
